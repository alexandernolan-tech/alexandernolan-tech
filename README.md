# 🌐 IT Troubleshooting Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of hands-on troubleshooting case studies.  
I use virtualized test environments and real-world problem scenarios to break systems on purpose, diagnose failures, and document clear, repeatable paths to resolution.  

My focus is developing strong analytical skills across Windows systems, networking fundamentals, and application-level behavior — all while writing documentation that mirrors professional IT workflows.

## 🔧 Featured Case Studies

### 🗂 **Windows File Picker Shell Corruption**  
Troubleshot and repaired a complex WinUI/shell failure where Open/Save dialogs stopped responding across multiple applications. Used UI subsystem analysis, shell component testing, and log review to restore normal functionality.

### 📡 **Home WiFi Random Disconnects**  
Diagnosed intermittent, multi-device connectivity drops. Identified wireless interference patterns, firmware issues, and router misbehavior. Documented short-term fixes and long-term prevention steps.

### 🎮 **Sims 4 DLC Not Recognized**  
Identified directory integrity and metadata issues preventing DLC enumeration. Rebuilt directory structure, cleaned corrupted files, validated permissions, and restored full content detection.

### 🧩 **Script Mod Loading Conflict**  
Applied structured 50/50 isolation to locate a single incompatible script mod blocking the entire mod loader. Rebuilt and validated the mod environment and documented a reusable troubleshooting workflow.

### 🌐 **DNS Misconfiguration & Network Failure**  
Simulated a DNS outage inside a Windows VM by configuring invalid DNS servers. Investigated failed hostname lookups, compared IP vs. hostname behavior, used `nslookup` to identify resolver failure, flushed DNS cache, and restored proper DNS resolution. Demonstrated clear differentiation between DNS layer issues and general network failures.

## 🖥 Technical Focus Areas

- Windows troubleshooting  
- Networking fundamentals (DNS, DHCP, routing, connectivity)  
- Virtualized environments (VirtualBox/VMs)  
- Application and system-level diagnostics  
- Log analysis & root-cause isolation  
- System configuration & dependency resolution  
- Repeatable documentation & knowledge-base style writing  

---

## 📚 Methodology

My case studies emphasize:  
- **Structured troubleshooting** using isolation, iterative testing, and reproducibility  
- **Clear documentation** (Symptoms → Investigation → Root Cause → Resolution → Verification)  
- **Understanding system behavior**, not just applying fixes  
- **Preventative guidance** and long-term reliability thinking
