# 🌐 IT Troubleshooting Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of hands-on troubleshooting case studies.  
I use virtualized test environments and real-world problem scenarios to break systems on purpose, diagnose failures, and document clear, repeatable paths to resolution.

My focus is developing strong analytical skills across Windows systems, networking fundamentals, and application-level behavior — while writing documentation that mirrors professional IT workflows.

## 🔧 Featured Case Studies

### 🗂 **Windows File Picker Shell Corruption**  
Troubleshot and repaired a complex WinUI/shell failure where Open/Save dialogs stopped responding across applications. Used UI subsystem analysis, shell component testing, and log review to restore normal functionality.

### 📡 **Home WiFi Random Disconnects**  
Diagnosed intermittent multi-device WiFi drops by analyzing router interference, firmware instability, and DHCP behavior. Documented short-term fixes and long-term stability steps.

### 🎮 **Sims 4 DLC Not Recognized**  
Investigated DLC detection failures caused by corrupted directory structure and metadata inconsistencies. Reconstructed full file paths, validated permissions, and restored proper content recognition.

### 🧩 **Script Mod Loading Conflict**  
Applied structured 50/50 isolation (binary search troubleshooting) to identify one incompatible script mod blocking the entire loader. Rebuilt the mod stack and produced reusable documentation for resolving large mod conflicts.

### 🌐 **DNS Misconfiguration & Network Failure**  
Simulated a DNS outage inside a Windows VM by assigning invalid DNS servers. Compared IP vs. hostname behavior, used `nslookup` to identify resolver failure, flushed DNS cache, corrected DNS configuration, and restored normal network resolution.

## 🖥 Technical Focus Areas

- Windows troubleshooting  
- Networking fundamentals (DNS, DHCP, routing, connectivity)  
- Virtualized environments (VirtualBox/VMs)  
- Application and system-level diagnostics  
- Log analysis & root-cause isolation  
- System configuration & dependency resolution  
- Repeatable documentation & knowledge-base style writing

---

## 📚 Methodology

My case studies emphasize:  
- **Structured troubleshooting** using isolation, iterative testing, and reproducibility  
- **Clear documentation** (Symptoms → Investigation → Root Cause → Resolution → Verification)  
- **Understanding system behavior**, not just applying fixes  
- **Preventative guidance** and long-term reliability thinking
