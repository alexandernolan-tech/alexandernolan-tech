# 👋 Hi, I’m Alexander

I’m an early-career IT support professional with a background in customer-facing leadership roles and a growing focus on systems troubleshooting, documentation, and technical analysis.  
I love breaking things (on purpose), figuring out why they broke, and writing clear, human-friendly documentation that helps others understand systems better.

Right now I’m building out my home lab, sharpening my troubleshooting methodology, and working toward my first IT Support / Help Desk / Desktop Support role — ideally in a creative, retail, or mission-driven environment.

## 🔧 What I’m Working On

- Building a hands-on troubleshooting portfolio using VMs, Windows environments, and simulated failures  
- Writing case studies that mirror real IT workflows (symptoms → investigation → root cause → resolution → verification)  
- Practicing networking fundamentals like DNS, DHCP, routing, and connectivity testing  
- Strengthening my documentation and reproducible problem-solving processes  
- Exploring roles that combine **customer experience + technical support**

A few of my favorite case studies:

- **Home WiFi Random Disconnects** — Analyzed multi-device connectivity problems using real-world interference patterns  
- **GitHub Link 404 Troubleshooting** — Resolved documentation path failures by correcting relative/absolute links

## ✨ Fun Stuff

- I troubleshoot games and mods for fun (and somehow always fix them).  
- I like systems that are *just* chaotic enough to be interesting.  
- I enjoy documenting problems as much as solving them.
