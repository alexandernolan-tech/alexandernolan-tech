# Hi, I'm Alexander 👋

I'm learning IT and systems administration through hands-on troubleshooting and personal projects.  
I enjoy digging into strange technical issues, understanding why systems break, and documenting clear, repeatable solutions.

This GitHub contains my case studies, methodologies, and notes as I work toward a role in helpdesk or junior sysadmin work.
