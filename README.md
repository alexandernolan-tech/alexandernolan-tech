# Hi, I'm Alexander 👋

I'm learning IT and systems administration through hands-on troubleshooting and personal projects.  
I enjoy digging into weird technical problems, understanding why systems break, and documenting clear, repeatable solutions.

This GitHub is where I keep my case studies, notes, and methodologies as I build toward a career in helpdesk or junior sysadmin roles.
